# Beeminder

Convenient access to [Beeminder]()'s API.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'beeminder'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install beeminder-gem

## Usage

First, get your token [here]() and log in:

    bee = Beeminder::User.new "username", "token"

Now you can do a bunch of stuff. You'll probably want to send a new datapoint:

    bee.send "weight", 86.3

Or you can find all goals of a certain type:

    odometer_goals = bee.goals.select {|g| g.goal_type = :biker}

Or maybe show the last updated graph in a widget somewhere:

   puts bee.goals.max_by(:updated_at).graph_url

There's also a simple tool called `beemind` to update graphs:

   $ beemind pushups 4

Check the [gem doc]() and [API]() for what else you can do.
